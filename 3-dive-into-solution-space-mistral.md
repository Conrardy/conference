Given the constraint that I have a small budget and only few hour each week to work. Given thoses concern : Pre-Conference Concerns:
Content Accessibility: Making information on speakers, talks, and workshops easily accessible to attendees. Personalization: Enabling attendees to filter sessions based on their specific interests and professional goals. Engagement and Anticipation: Creating excitement about the event with teaser content and interactive sessions.
During the Conference Concerns:
Spatial Orientation: Assisting attendees in navigating the venue to locate sessions and amenities. Time Management: Helping attendees manage their schedules to attend sessions on time. Real-time Updates: Offering current information on any session changes or logistical adjustments.
Implementation Considerations:
Technology Stack: Choosing appropriate technologies that allow for rapid development and easy maintenance. Budget: Utilizing cost-effective tools and services to build the solution within a small budget. Time Management: Prioritizing development efforts on essential features that can be delivered with limited time resources.
These concerns are critical for tailoring a solution that not only enhances the attendee experience but also addresses the logistical challenges of organizing conferences and events in the software development and agile methodologies domain.

Let define the best technologie to solve this problem.
I need to use angular and tailwind at least.
I need to ship something fast. and have a CI/CD
```

To address the concerns and requirements mentioned, it would be beneficial to consider using Angular for building the front-end of the event management solution. Tailwind can be used as an optional CSS framework to provide a consistent look and feel across different components.

To enhance accessibility, personalization, and engagement, features such as session filtering, chat functionality, and live polls or quizzes can be incorporated into the Angular application. For spatial orientation, a map feature using Google Maps API or another similar service can be implemented to assist attendees in navigating the venue.

To address real-time updates, a messaging system such as Firebase or Socket.io can be used to provide notifications and updates to attendees about any changes or adjustments to the event schedule or logistics.

For technology stack, it would be beneficial to consider using serverless architecture, such as AWS Lambda or Azure Functions, for hosting and running the back-end services. This approach can reduce development time and cost while providing scalability and flexibility.

To manage the development process, a CI/CD pipeline can be set up using tools such as Jenkins or GitLab CI/CD to automate the build, test, and deployment processes. This will allow for efficient development and testing, ensuring that the solution is delivered on time and within budget.

In summary, Angular with Tailwind CSS, a messaging system for real-time updates, serverless architecture, and a CI/CD pipeline can be used to address the concerns and requirements mentioned while also delivering an efficient, accessible, and engaging event management solution.
