# Enhanced AI Application Development Strategy

## Introduction

This document outlines a refined strategy for developing an application that utilizes Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, focusing on leveraging ChatGPT, LM Studio, and local open-source models. Our approach emphasizes an in-depth exploration of the business domain prior to integrating AI functionalities, ensuring the application directly addresses industry-specific requirements.

## Development Process Overview

Our development methodology is designed to ensure a thorough understanding of the business domain, leading to the creation of a bespoke AI-enhanced application. This process includes:

### 1. In-depth Business Domain Conversations

- **Objective**: To engage directly with AI tools such as ChatGPT or a local model to collect comprehensive insights into the industry, highlighting challenges, opportunities, and customer experiences.
- **Outcome**: A profound understanding of the domain, which will inform all further development steps.

### 2. Compilation of a Domain Glossary and Definition of Boundaries

- **Glossary Compilation**: Assemble a detailed glossary of industry-specific terminology, concepts, and acronyms to ensure clear communication and consistency throughout the project.
- **Boundary Setting**: Clearly outline the scope of the business domain, identifying the project's focus areas and excluding irrelevant aspects.
- **Customer Experience Documentation**: Detail the daily life, challenges, and interactions of the target customer demographic within the business domain.

### 3. Transformation into AI Development Prompts

- **Prompt Formulation**: Convert the detailed domain insights into generalized AI prompts. These will guide the AI model development and training process, ensuring alignment with actual use cases and customer requirements.

### Integration of AI Prompts into the Development Workflow

- **Tool Integration**: Incorporate the AI prompts into Espanso (or a comparable tool), facilitating efficient coding and ensuring consistent AI interactions throughout the development process.

### 4. Goal and Problem Definition

- **Objective Clarification**: Define the specific objectives the application aims to achieve within the business domain, based on gathered insights.
- **Problem Framing**: Identify and articulate the primary problems the application will address, ensuring they are clearly understood.

### 5. Decomposition of the Problem

- **Modular Approach**: Break down the main problem into smaller, more manageable tasks. This strategy allows for targeted development efforts and simplifies progress monitoring.

### 6. Step-by-Step Implementation

- **Iterative Execution**: Approach each task sequentially, employing AI tools and models strategically to address particular issues.
- **Continuous Evaluation**: Regularly test the application and solicit feedback, using the responses to refine and improve the development process.

## Conclusion

Adopting this comprehensive development flow ensures that our AI-driven application is deeply integrated with an understanding of the business domain, tailored to meet specific industry challenges. From initial AI interactions to detailed task execution, this methodology guarantees that the final product not only resolves identified problems but also significantly enhances customer engagement within the domain.

## Next Steps

- **AI Engagement for Domain Analysis**: Begin domain analysis by engaging with AI technologies such as ChatGPT or local models to gather in-depth insights.
- **AI Prompt Formulation**: Leverage these insights to generate AI prompts for model training and interactive purposes.
- **Detailed Project Planning**: Develop a detailed plan for addressing the defined problems, including timelines and assigned responsibilities.

This strategy ensures both the efficiency and effectiveness of the application development process, delivering a solution that is highly responsive to the needs of the business domain and its customers.
