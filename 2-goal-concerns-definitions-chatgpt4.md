### Pre-Conference: Browsing, Detailing, and Filtering Speakers and Workshops

#### Concerns:
1. **Content Accessibility**: Ensuring that attendees can easily access information about speakers, talks, and workshops.
2. **Personalization**: Allowing users to filter content based on their interests, expertise level, and professional goals.
3. **Engagement and Anticipation**: Generating interest and excitement about the event through teaser content, speaker interviews, or interactive Q&A sessions.

#### Persona Interactions:
- **Attendees** may seek to plan their conference experience in advance, preferring to create a personalized agenda that aligns with their professional development goals. For example, a software developer might look for sessions on the latest in DevOps practices, while an Agile coach may focus on workshops about Scrum methodologies.
- **Speakers and Workshop Leaders** could provide detailed abstracts of their sessions, including key takeaways, intended audience, and prerequisite knowledge, helping attendees make informed decisions.
- **Event Organizers** need a streamlined way to update session information, speaker profiles, and schedules in real-time to reflect any changes.

#### Solution Approach:
Develop a lightweight, mobile-friendly web application or utilize a cost-effective event management platform that offers:
- An intuitive UI for browsing events, including search and filter capabilities.
- Personalization features, allowing users to bookmark sessions, create custom agendas, and receive recommendations based on their interests.
- Integration with social media or a dedicated event app for sharing and engagement.

### During the Conference: Navigating the Venue

#### Concerns:
1. **Spatial Orientation**: Helping attendees locate sessions, workshops, and amenities within the venue.
2. **Time Management**: Assisting attendees in getting to their sessions on time, including reminders and notifications.
3. **Real-time Updates**: Providing up-to-the-minute information on session changes, room swaps, or other logistical adjustments.

#### Persona Interactions:
- **Attendees** might experience stress finding their way around, especially in large or complex venues. An attendee could benefit from a digital map with real-time directions to their next session.
- **Event Staff** can assist attendees on the ground, but digital tools can augment their ability to provide information and manage crowd flow.
- **Sponsors and Exhibitors** might be located strategically around the venue; guiding attendees through these areas can increase engagement and value for sponsors.

#### Solution Approach:
Integrate a venue map feature within your web application or event app that includes:
- Interactive, digital maps of the venue with searchable locations for sessions, workshops, food, and restrooms.
- GPS or Bluetooth beacon integration for indoor navigation, if feasible within budget and technical constraints.
- Notifications for upcoming sessions, with directions and estimated walking times.

### Implementation Considerations:

- **Technology Stack**: Choose a stack you're comfortable with, considering rapid development frameworks and platforms that offer pre-built features (e.g., event management solutions, mobile app builders).
- **Budget**: Leverage free or low-cost tools and services. For example, Google Maps API for venue mapping, or WordPress with event management plugins for content.
- **Time Management**: Focus on MVP (Minimum Viable Product) features that address the primary goals. Prioritize development to first release the browsing and filtering capability, followed by the venue navigation closer to the event date.

### Final Thoughts:
Given your constraints of working alone and having a few hours a week, it's critical to maintain a lean approach. Start with the most essential features that will provide the most significant impact on the attendee experience. Utilize feedback loops with potential users (like conducting surveys within your target audience or agile testing with colleagues) to refine the app iteratively. This iterative approach not only aligns with agile methodologies but also ensures that you are building a solution that genuinely meets the needs of your attendees and other personas involved.

### Why Implement Content Accessibility First?

#### Foundation for Engagement
- Accessibility of information about speakers, talks, and workshops is foundational for engagement and personalization. Without it, other efforts are less effective.

#### Immediate Value to Attendees
- Providing detailed information offers immediate value, enabling informed decisions about participation, crucial for driving registrations and early engagement.

#### Leverage for Further Development
- Establishing a robust system for content accessibility makes it easier to add features such as personalization and real-time updates, which depend on the underlying data and accessibility framework.

#### Technical and Budget Considerations
- This feature can be achieved with minimal technical complexity and within budget constraints, utilizing existing systems to expedite development and focus on user experience.

#### Pre-Event Engagement
- Early engagement, facilitated by accessible content, is crucial for the event's success, allowing attendees to plan their schedules and enhancing the overall experience.

### Why Not the Others First?

- **Personalization** and **Engagement and Anticipation** enhance the core experience but are more effective after establishing content access.
- **Spatial Orientation** and **Time Management** are critical during the event but require prior attendee engagement with the content.
- **Real-time Updates** presuppose that attendees are using the platform and that content is being accessed, making them secondary to the foundational need for content accessibility.

Implementing Content Accessibility first addresses immediate attendee needs, provides a foundation for additional features, and ensures alignment with engagement goals and logistical feasibility.
