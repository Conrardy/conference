given this context create an MVP. 

Problem : find a conference in a list and browse a single track of talks or workshops following a timeline.

Example :
Choose "Agile Tour Monpellier 2024" in the list of conference
Browse in "Grand hall" tracks and get "Keynote, 9:15 - 10:00", "How to use IA 10:10-10:55"

Describe step by step to create this MVP.

# MVP Development Plan for Conference Browsing Application

To create an MVP that addresses the problem of finding a conference in a list and browsing a single track of talks or workshops following a timeline, we can follow these steps:

## Step 1: Define the User Story and Requirements for the MVP

Create a user story that outlines the requirements for the MVP, such as:

- As a user, I want to be able to search for conferences in a list and select a conference from the list.
- Once I have selected a conference, I want to be able to browse a single track of talks or workshops following a timeline.

## Step 2: Design the Data Model

Design a data model that represents the conference, talks, and workshops. This could include:

- **Conference**: name, location, date, start_time, end_time
- **Track**: name, description, list of talks or workshops
- **Talk/Workshop**: title, speaker, description, start_time, end_time

## Step 3: Implement the UI

Implement a user interface that allows users to search for conferences and view a list of available conferences. Once a conference is selected, the UI should display a single track of talks or workshops with their corresponding start and end times.

## Step 4: Implement the Data Storage and Retrieval

Implement data storage and retrieval mechanisms that allow users to search for conferences and view available tracks and talks/workshops. This could include using a database such as Firebase Realtime Database or SQLite to store and retrieve the conference, talk/workshop, and track data.

## Step 5: Implement Real-time Updates and Messaging

Implement real-time updates and messaging functionality using Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or a similar service. This will allow users to receive notifications about changes or updates to the conference schedule or logistics.

## Step 6: Integrate with Other Services

Integrate the MVP with other relevant services such as Google Maps API for spatial navigation and GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

## Step 7: Test and Deploy

Test the MVP thoroughly to ensure that it meets the requirements and addresses any issues or bugs. Once testing is complete, deploy the MVP to a hosting platform such as Vercel for production use.

In summary, creating an MVP to address the problem of finding a conference in a list and browsing a single track of talks or workshops following a timeline involves designing a data model, implementing a user interface, storing and retrieving data, implementing real-time updates and messaging, integrating with other services, and testing and deploying the solution.
